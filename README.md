Description

This project is a basic introduction to Node.js and the CommonJS module system.

Earlier, JavaScript was mainly used inside web browsers.
With Node.js, JavaScript can now run outside the browser on the server or system.

In this project:

A simple utility module is created

The module exports a function using module.exports

Another file imports the function using require()

This shows how code sharing works in Node.js

The project helps beginners understand how Node.js executes JavaScript files and how different files can communicate with each other.

Project Files

utility.js – Contains a simple function and exports it

main.js – Imports the function and uses it

package.json – Created when Node project is initialized
